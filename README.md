# Authorship or acknowledgement?

My ([**@awickert**](https://github.com/awickert)'s) philosophy on academic coauthorship is to leave the door open and see who walks through. This feels friendly and places free collaboration in the place of academic gatekeeping. Of course, to pass through the threshold, there must be some amount of reasonable contribution to deserve the coauthorship, and it is best that this is not arbitrary (or else the gatekeepers stealthily return). Our research group therefore follows a modified version of [**@RolfHut**](https://github.com/RolfHut)'s approach.

There are four contribution categories:

* Collecting the data / writing the model / designing and/or building the aparatus
* Analyzing the data / running the model / deploying the aparatus
* Writing the paper (investing in writing it; this is >> small comments and edits)
* Funding/conceptualizing/coordinating the project: This involves developing original ideas and hypotheses, obtaining key grants for the work (substantial amount of the total salary, field work, lab/analytical expenses, equipment expenses, and page charges), and/or coordinating researchers to address the research questions

**Have you fulfilled one category? You are included in the acknowledgements.**

**Have you contributed in two or more categories? You are an author.**

<!-- The above points are predacated on **academic honesty**. -->
