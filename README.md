# Authorship or acknowledgement?

My ([**@awickert**](https://github.com/awickert)'s) philosophy on academic coauthorship is to leave the door open and see who walks through. This feels friendly and places free collaboration in the place of academic gatekeeping. Of course, to pass through the threshold, there must be some amount of reasonable contribution to deserve the coauthorship, and it is best that this is not arbitrary (or else the gatekeepers stealthily return). Our research group therefore follows [**@RolfHut**](https://github.com/RolfHut)'s approach, though perhaps with some light-to-nearly-invisible modification.

There are four contribution categories:

* Collecting the data / writing the model / designing and/or building the aparatus
* Analyzing the data / running the model / deploying the aparatus
* Writing the paper (investing in writing it; this is >> small comments and edits)
* Funding the project (large currency: substantial salary, field work, lab/analytical expenses, equipment expenses, etc.)

**Have you fulfilled one category? You are included in the acknowledgements.**

**Have you contributed in two or more categories? You are an author.**
